        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Mercury_in_true_color.jpg" alt="Mercury">
        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun.</p>
        <p>Mercury, the smallest planet, is also the fastest to orbit the Sun, completing a revolution in just 88 days.
          Despite its proximity to the Sun, it's not the hottest planet—Venus holds that title.</p>
        <p>It has an extremely thin atmosphere, resulting in wild temperature fluctuations from day to night. The
          surface is heavily cratered like the Moon, showing its ancient history.</p>
        <p>Mercury has no moons and no rings. Space missions like NASA’s MESSENGER have provided valuable data about its
          magnetic field and surface composition.</p>
        <p>Recent findings even indicate the presence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters near its poles—an
          exciting discovery for such a hot planet.</p>

      <div class="planet-card planet-card-venus">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Venus-real_color.jpg" alt="Venus">
        <h2>Venus</h2>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Venus is the hottest planet due to its thick atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Venus is often called Earth’s twin because of its similar size and structure, but it's a hostile world. Thick
          clouds of sulfuric acid trap heat, making Venus the hottest planet in the solar system.</p>
        <p>Its surface temperature can melt lead, and the pressure is over 90 times that of Earth’s. Venus rotates very
          slowly and in the opposite direction compared to most planets.</p>
        <p>The planet has mountains, volcanoes, and vast plains, many of which are shaped by volcanic activity. However,
          its extreme environment makes exploration very difficult.</p>
        <p>Probes like Venera and Magellan have given us a glimpse beneath the clouds, but much about Venus remains a
          mystery scientists hope to solve.</p>

      <div class="planet-card planet-card-earth">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg" alt="Earth">
        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Earth is the only planet known to support life.</p>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known world that supports life. With abundant water, a
          breathable atmosphere, and a magnetic field, Earth is uniquely suited for living organisms.</p>
        <p>Its surface is 70% water, which plays a crucial role in regulating temperature and supporting biodiversity.
          Earth's atmosphere protects it from harmful solar radiation and helps retain warmth.</p>
        <p>Earth’s geology is dynamic, with plate tectonics that shape continents and trigger earthquakes. Its climate
          zones range from polar to tropical, allowing for diverse ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Ongoing human activity has begun to alter Earth’s environment significantly, leading to global discussions
          about sustainability and conservation.</p>

      <div class="planet-card planet-card-mars">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/OSIRIS_Mars_true_color.jpg" alt="Mars">
        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Mars is often called the Red Planet due to its reddish appearance.</p>
        <p>Mars has captivated scientists and the public alike for centuries. Its iron-rich soil gives it a red hue, and
          it has seasons, polar ice caps, and evidence of ancient water flow.</p>
        <p>It’s home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris.
          Despite its thin atmosphere, Mars shows signs it may have once supported life.</p>
        <p>Rovers like Perseverance and Curiosity continue to explore its terrain, searching for biosignatures and
          understanding its geology.</p>
        <p>With growing interest in human colonization, Mars may soon become the next frontier in space exploration.</p>

      <div class="planet-card planet-card-jupiter">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Jupiter.jpg" alt="Jupiter">
        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system.</p>
        <p>Jupiter is a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. It has a massive magnetic field and dozens of
          moons, including Ganymede—the largest moon in the solar system.</p>
        <p>Its Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter has strong winds,
          lightning, and intense radiation belts.</p>
        <p>The planet plays a key role in shielding the inner solar system from asteroids by attracting or deflecting
          them with its gravity.</p>
        <p>Jupiter’s moon Europa is especially interesting, as it's believed to have a subsurface ocean that may harbor
          life.</p>

      <div class="planet-card planet-card-saturn">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Saturn_during_Equinox.jpg" alt="Saturn">
        <h2>Saturn</h2>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Saturn is famous for its prominent ring system.</p>
        <p>Saturn is a gas giant like Jupiter but is best known for its beautiful rings made of ice and rock particles.
          The rings extend thousands of kilometers but are only meters thick.</p>
        <p>It has at least 145 moons, including Titan, which has lakes of liquid methane and a thick atmosphere. Titan
          is one of the few places in the solar system with stable surface liquids.</p>
        <p>Saturn's low density means it could float in water, and its atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrogen and
          helium.</p>
        <p>Missions like Cassini have vastly improved our understanding of Saturn and its moons, revealing complex
          weather patterns and hidden oceans beneath icy surfaces.</p>

      <div class="planet-card planet-card-uranus">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Uranus2.jpg" alt="Uranus">
        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Uranus rotates on its side, unlike any other planet.</p>
        <p>Uranus is known for its unique tilt—it rotates nearly horizontally relative to its orbit. This results in
          extreme seasonal variations during its 84-year orbit around the Sun.</p>
        <p>The planet has a pale blue color due to methane in its atmosphere, and it’s classified as an ice giant along
          with Neptune.</p>
        <p>Uranus has a faint ring system and 27 known moons. Its interior is mostly icy materials and rock, with a
          small core.</p>
        <p>Despite being discovered over 200 years ago, Uranus remains one of the least explored planets, awaiting
          future missions to uncover its secrets.</p>

      <div class="planet-card planet-card-neptune">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Neptune_Full.jpg" alt="Neptune">
        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Neptune is the windiest planet in the solar system.</p>
        <p>Neptune is a deep blue ice giant with supersonic winds reaching over 2,000 km/h. It’s the farthest planet
          from the Sun and has a rocky core surrounded by a thick atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Its largest moon, Triton, orbits in the opposite direction of Neptune’s rotation and is believed to be a
          captured object.</p>
        <p>Neptune has dark storms similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, although they appear and disappear more
          frequently.</p>
        <p>Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune, providing vital data that fuels current scientific
          theories.</p>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Nh-pluto-in-true-color_2x_JPEG-edit-frame.jpg"
          alt="Pluto">
        <h2>Pluto</h2>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Pluto is classified as a dwarf planet.</p>
        <p>Once the ninth planet, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. It resides in the Kuiper Belt and
          has five known moons, with Charon being the largest.</p>
        <p>Pluto has a heart-shaped glacier made of nitrogen ice and a thin atmosphere that expands as it approaches the
          Sun.</p>
        <p>The New Horizons mission revealed surprising geological activity on Pluto, challenging previous assumptions
          that it was a frozen, dead world.</p>
        <p>Despite its small size, Pluto continues to fascinate scientists and space lovers, playing a key role in
          redefining our understanding of planets.</p>
